## Overview
[Amazon EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/) let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at steep discounts. Key benefits include:

💰 **Cost Optimization**
- Up to 90% cost savings compared to On-Demand instances
- Ideal for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads
- Pay only for what you use

⚡ **Scalability**
- Access to large-scale compute capacity
- Perfect for batch processing and stateless applications
- Automatic capacity rebalancing

🔄 **Flexibility**
- Mix of instance types and sizes
- Automatic instance selection based on availability
- Graceful interruption handling

## Architecture
This example demonstrates how to run workloads on Spot instances in EKS Auto Mode using Karpenter's spot instance management capabilities.

**Key Components**:
📄 **NodePool Template**
- Defines Spot instance requirements
- Available [here](../../nodepool-templates/spot-nodepool.yaml.tpl)
- Supports c, m, and r instance families
- ARM64 architecture for cost efficiency

🔄 **Load Balancer**
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Exposes the application to external traffic

🎮 **Sample Application**
- 2048 game (sliding tile puzzle)
- Stateless application ideal for spot instances

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup EKS Auto Mode Cluster
First, we'll set up our EKS cluster using Terraform:

```bash
cd sample-aws-eks-auto-mode/terraform

terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

$(terraform output -raw configure_kubectl)
```

### 2. Deploy Spot NodePool
Deploy the NodePool that will manage our Spot instances:

```bash
cd ../nodepools

kubectl apply -f spot-nodepool.yaml
```

> ⚠️ The Spot NodePool applies the following taint to ensure workloads are spot-aware:
>
> ```yaml
> taints:
>   - key: "spot"
>     value: "true"
>     effect: "NoSchedule"   # Prevents non-spot-aware pods from scheduling
> ```
>
> Any pods that need to run on Spot nodes must include matching tolerations in their specifications. This ensures workloads are designed to handle spot instance interruptions.

### 3. Deploy the 2048 Game
Deploy our spot-compatible 2048 game application:

```bash
cd ../examples/spot

kubectl apply -f game-2048.yaml
```

> ✅ The 2048 game deployment includes the required configuration for Spot instances:
>
> ```yaml
> tolerations:
>   - key: "spot"     # Matches the Spot node taint
>     value: "true"
>     effect: "NoSchedule"   # Allows scheduling on tainted nodes
>
> nodeSelector:
>   karpenter.sh/capacity-type: spot   # Ensures pods run on spot instances
> ```
>
> This configuration ensures the pods can run on Spot instances and are scheduled appropriately.

### 4. Configure Load Balancer
Set up the Application Load Balancer using Ingress:

```bash
kubectl apply -f 2048-ingress.yaml
```

### 5. Access the Application
After the ALB is provisioned (usually takes 5-10 minutes):

1. Get the ALB hostname:
```bash
kubectl get ingress ingress-2048 \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}' \
  -n game-2048-spot
```

2. Open the URL in your browser to play the 2048 game! 🎮

## Cleanup

🧹 Follow these steps to clean up all resources:

### 1. Remove Kubernetes Resources
First, remove the application and node pool:

```bash
# Remove application components
kubectl delete -f 2048-ingress.yaml
kubectl delete -f game-2048.yaml

# Remove Spot node pool
kubectl delete -f ../../nodepools/spot-nodepool.yaml
```

### 2. Remove Cluster (Optional)
If you're done with the entire cluster:

```bash
# Navigate to Terraform directory
cd ../../terraform

# Initialize and destroy infrastructure
terraform init
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This will delete the entire EKS cluster and all associated resources. Make sure you want to proceed.

## Troubleshooting

🔧 Common issues and their solutions:

### 🎯 Spot Instance Issues
1. **Capacity Unavailability**
   - Monitor instance capacity with AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-spot-instance-requests \
       --filters "Name=status-code,Values=capacity-not-available"
     ```
   - Check NodePool events:
     ```bash
     kubectl describe nodepool spot-nodepool
     ```

2. **Instance Interruptions**
   - Monitor interruption events:
     ```bash
     kubectl get events --field-selector reason=SpotInterruption
     ```
   - Review pod eviction status:
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -n game-2048 -o wide
     ```

### 🔄 Load Balancer Issues
1. **ALB Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check ALB controller logs
   kubectl logs -n kube-system \
     deployment/aws-load-balancer-controller
   ```

2. **Ingress Status**
   ```bash
   # Check ingress status
   kubectl describe ingress ingress-2048 -n game-2048
   ```

> 💡 **Tip**: Use `kubectl get events` to monitor spot instance lifecycle events and pod rescheduling.
